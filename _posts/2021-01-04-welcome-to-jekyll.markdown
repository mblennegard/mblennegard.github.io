The blog is finally up, after pondering about it for way too long. As one often do, you get stuck with analysis paralysis, in this case for everything from the actual name of the blog to which technology to use for actually publishing the blog.
During the christmas holiday, I finally decided to just move forward. The name you probably already have seen and the technology fell on hosting the blog via Github Pages and publishing it with Jekyll (which was far more complicated to get working locally than it probably should've been, so I might write a blog post about that subject)

My main focus will be on writing about Microsoft's Power Platform and I already have multiple planned blog posts about Power Automate, Power Apps and Power Virtual Agents.
Stay tuned in the coming weeks for the first real posts.
