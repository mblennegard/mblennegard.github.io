# Welcome to my blog!

## Who is **marble**?

So, first off, who is marble? Well, that is me of course. :)
My name is Marcus Blenneg√•rd and I work as a Microsoft 365 Solutions Architect at Sogeti Sweden.

I have been working as a consultant since 2015. I started off as a SharePoint Developer, but as time went by, and as Microsoft expanded upon the products and services within their Microsoft 365 offering, I broadened my skillset as well.

## Purpose

The purpose of this blog is to provide information, tutorials and how-to guides on things related to Microsoft 365.

I will mainly be writing about Microsoft's Power Platform, including Power Apps and Power Automate, which I am a big proponent of in my daily work. There will also be, although less frequently, blog posts related to other areas of Microsoft 365, Azure, PowerShell etc.
